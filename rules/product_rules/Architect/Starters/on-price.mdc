# On Price Drop Starter

## What is On Price Drop?

The **On Price Drop Starter** triggers a journey when the price of a specific product decreases and the user has previously interacted with that product.

Price changes are tracked across all platforms: web, mobile app, and offline product feeds.  
This starter is ideal for **real-time, conversion-focused** campaigns.

---

## How It Works

- The user must have performed a selected event (e.g., product view, add to cart, add to favorites) **on a specific product**.
- If that productâ€™s price drops by a defined amount or percentage, the journey is triggered automatically.
- The price drop is detected through the **Product Feed system**.
- The event must include a **`pid` (Product ID)** parameter â€” it is required to link the user interaction to the specific product.

## Additional Filtering & Segmentation

### ðŸ”¹ Event Filters (optional)
- Narrow targeting based on specific user actions and event parameters.

### ðŸ”¹ Product Attribute Filters
- Filter by product category, currency, stock quantity, original price, etc.

### ðŸ”¹ Audience Segmentation
- Add segments based on:
  - Purchase probability
  - RFM status
  - Saved or predefined segments

---

## Usage Examples

- Users who viewed a product but didnâ€™t purchase, and the price dropped
- Price dropped on a product in the userâ€™s cart
- Price dropped on a product in the userâ€™s favorites list
- Alerting users subscribed to a price alert
- Offering coupons to users who purchased a product before the price drop

## Requirements

To use this starter:

- âœ… **Product Catalog Integration**: via Clickstream, XML feed, or Catalog API
- âœ… **Insider Tag & SDK** integration must be complete
- âœ… System rules must be defined
- âœ… Events must be sent from relevant platforms

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use "All Languages" to avoid language-based targeting gaps.
- Combine product filters and audience segmentation for precision.
- Do not use Wait element in urgent, price-sensitive scenarios.
- Use **Constant Price Drop Attributes** to personalize message content (e.g., new price, original price, % drop).

---

## FAQs

- Price **increase** cannot be used as a trigger.
- Stock availability is used only in filtering, not during message delivery.
- If multiple products drop in price, only **one** can be displayed per message.
- For price alert scenarios, a **custom event and `pid`** are required.
