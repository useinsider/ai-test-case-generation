# On Back in Stock Starter

## What is On Back in Stock?

The **On Back in Stock Starter** triggers a journey when a product that was previously out of stock becomes available again, and the user has previously interacted with that product.

Stock updates are tracked across all platforms including web, mobile app, and offline product databases.  
This starter is ideal for **real-time re-engagement campaigns** targeting product interest.

---

## How It Works

- The user must have performed a selected event (e.g., product view, add to cart, add to favorites) for a specific product.
- When that product comes back in stock, the journey is triggered automatically.
- The **Product ID (`pid`)** event parameter is required to associate the event with the product.

**Note**: Stock condition is binary â€” "in stock" or "out of stock". Quantity is **not** used in the trigger logic.

## Filtering & Segmentation

### ðŸ”¹ Event Filters (Optional)
- Filter users by specific events or event parameters (e.g., exclude category = Clearance).

### ðŸ”¹ Product Attribute Filters
- Filter based on product category, brand, price range, or other attributes.

### ðŸ”¹ Audience Segmentation
- Add segments based on:
  - Purchase probability
  - RFM status
  - Saved, predefined, predictive, or integrated segments

---

## Usage Examples

- Users who viewed a product thatâ€™s now back in stock
- Users who added a product to cart or favorites, and itâ€™s now available
- Users who subscribed to a stock alert for a product
- Sending alerts for newly restocked bestsellers

---

## Requirements

To use this starter:

- âœ… **Product Catalog Integration** must be enabled (Clickstream, XML feed, or Catalog API)
- âœ… Insider Tag & SDK must be active
- âœ… System rules must be defined and events properly tracked
- âœ… `pid` parameter must be included in relevant events

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use "All Languages" to ensure maximum audience inclusion
- Avoid using **Wait** element in time-sensitive restock alerts
- Stock amount is not checked; only **stock status** is considered (`in_stock = true`)
- Combine filters and segments to create focused retargeting flows
