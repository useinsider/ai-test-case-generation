# Wait for Some Time

## What is Wait for Some Time?

The **Wait for Some Time** element delays the user's progress in a journey for a predefined duration.  
Itâ€™s used to **pause the flow** before taking the next action â€” ideal for creating spaced-out interactions.

The wait duration can be adjusted based on your business goals, message timing strategy, or user behavior expectations.

---

## How It Works

- When a user reaches this Wait element, the countdown begins.
- After the defined time elapses, the user moves to the next step in the journey.
- You can set the wait time in minutes, hours, or days.

---

## Time Limitations

- âœ… **Minimum wait time**: 10 minutes  
  (to allow time for attribute and event updates)
- âœ… **Maximum per element**: 3 months  
- âœ… **Total journey wait time**: 6 months  
- ðŸš« Two same-type wait elements **cannot be placed consecutively**.

---

## Usage Examples

- Wait 15 minutes after a cart is abandoned to check if itâ€™s still abandoned.
- Wait 1 day after an email is opened to send a follow-up.
- Wait 1 hour after a user signs up to trigger a welcome message.

---

## How to Configure

1. In the Canvas, click the **"+"** button and select **Wait for Some Time**.
2. Set the desired duration (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 day).
3. Click Save and return to the journey flow.

## Best Practices & Tips

- After pausing a journey, you can **adjust the wait time** â€” only new users will follow the new timing after restart.
- Donâ€™t stack this element back-to-back to avoid flow issues.
- Choose wait times based on natural user behavior (e.g., decision cycles, time to open an email).
