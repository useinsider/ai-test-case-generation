    # Check Reachability

    ## What is Check Reachability?

    The **Check Reachability** element checks whether a user is reachable via specific communication channels such as Email, SMS, Push, or WhatsApp.

    It helps optimize journeys by preventing message attempts to unreachable users and offering fallback paths.

    ---

    ## How It Works

    - When a user reaches this element, Architect verifies if they can be reached via the selected channel(s).
    - If the user is reachable via any of the selected channels, they proceed down one path.
    - If not, they are routed to an alternate path.

    Supported channels include:
    - ðŸ“§ Email
    - ðŸ“± SMS
    - ðŸ”” Web Push
    - ðŸ“² App Push
    - ðŸ’¬ WhatsApp

    ## Use Cases

    - Ensure email reachability before sending a campaign message.
    - Avoid push attempts for users who havenâ€™t opted in to push notifications.
    - Route unreachable users to a fallback channel (e.g., web push instead of SMS).
    - Personalize flows based on preferred or available channels.

    ## Best Practices

    - Always use this check before critical communication steps to avoid bounce or delivery errors.
    - Design fallback journeys for users who are not reachable on the intended channel.
    - Combine with **Next Best Channel** to dynamically choose the most effective option.
