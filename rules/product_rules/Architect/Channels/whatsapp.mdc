# WhatsApp Channel
## What is WhatsApp?
WhatsApp is a communication channel within the Insider platform that allows sending messages to users directly through WhatsApp. This channel supports single and conversational message types, enables automation, personalization, and chatbot integration through templates.
---
## Key Features
* **Single and Conversational Messages**
  - **Single Message**: Sends one message with no follow-up regardless of user response.
  - **Conversational Message**: Sends a message with predefined buttons. If the user selects a defined option, a corresponding follow-up message is sent. Includes fallback handling and timeout behavior.
* **Message Templates**
  - Templates can include variables (e.g., `{{first_name}}`, `{{last_visited_product}}`).
  - If required variables are missing, the message will not be sent.
* **Short URLs**
  - Automatically shortens URLs (like product pages) to prevent long, unattractive links.
* **External Platform Response**
  - For conversational templates, button clicks can send webhook requests to external systems (e.g., chatbots).
* **Test Messaging**
  - Messages can be tested by sending to a specific number after enabling the relevant checkbox for authorization.
* **Preview as User**
  - Preview message appearance for a selected user using variables from the user profile.

## Use Cases
* **Conversational Campaigns**
  - Engage users with interactive buttons to drive real-time actions (e.g., "View Product", "Talk to Agent").
* **Promotions**
  - Share limited-time offers, sales, and product launches directly to WhatsApp.
* **Notifications**
  - Order updates, delivery alerts, appointment reminders.

## Technical Notes & Tips
* **User Requirements**
  - Users must have the following attributes:
    - `whats_app_business_opt_in`: `true`
    - `wbo`: `true`
    - `pn` (phone number): not empty
* **Timeout Handling**
  - In conversational flows, a timeout action can be defined (e.g., drop user or move to next step).
* **Variable Handling**
  - If a template uses variables and the user lacks the required data, the message will not be sent.
* **Dynamic Content**
  - Can be previewed for specific users using the "Preview as User" option.

## Actions
The type of WhatsApp message template selected determines which action is automatically applied in the Journey:
### Promotional (Single) Templates
- When a **Single** message template is selected, the Journey action is automatically set to **on send**.
- The message is sent, and the user immediately continues to the next step.
- If the user replies, nothing happens — the reply is ignored.
### Conversational Templates
- When a **Conversational** (button-based) template is selected and saved, the Journey action is automatically set to **on reply**.
- The system waits for the user to respond by clicking one of the buttons.
- If a button is clicked, the corresponding flow continues.
- This also applies to **Carousel** templates — they use **on reply** as well.
> The action type is automatically applied based on the selected template.
