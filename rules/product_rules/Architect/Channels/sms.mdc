# SMS Overview

## What is SMS?

SMS (Short Messaging Service) is a direct communication channel that allows sending text messages to users' mobile phones using their personal phone numbers. It enables broad reach, including to offline users, and is known for high engagement rates.

- **Read Rate:** 90% of SMS messages are read within 3 minutes.
- **Open Rate:** Estimated at 99%.
- **Channel Type:** Available in the Architect as a journey flow element.

## How Does It Work?

When users reach the SMS element in a journey, a personalized SMS is sent individually. The system first checks:

- If the user has a valid phone number
- If the phone number is in E.164 format
- If the user has opted-in to SMS
- If the user has GDPR consent

SMS will **not** be sent if any of these conditions fail.

### Message Rules:

- Max 160 characters per message.
- Messages >160 chars are split and charged as multiple SMS.
- URL links can be shortened with the **Shorten URL** function.
- Multi-country sending is limited by regulations and requires SMS provider approval.

## Tips and Tricks

- Use **Check Reachability** before SMS to avoid user loss.
- Use **Wait Until a Time Slot** to respect silent hours (e.g., no SMS between 10PM-8AM in some countries).
- Avoid prohibited content (e.g., pornographic, misleading, gambling in some areas).
- Pre-approval might be required for content or sender ID.

- If you set Channel Frequency Capping before, when you enable Send Time Optimization, Bypass Channel Frequency Capping will be automatically enabled.

### Step 7: Bypass Frequency Capping
Insider provides sending sms out from the sms campaigns as well as from Architect. The risk of subscribers getting too many sms is getting higher, which can be very disruptive and may result in unsubscribing from your brand. With the Sms Frequency Capping, you can limit the number of sms a user can receive in a specified period like sending a maximum of 5 sms to a user in one day.Architect enables you to bypass the sms frequency capping if you have configured any.

Journeys are for real-time cases and they require users to receive sms based on their actions. Therefore, you may want to override the global frequency capping you set for your sms.
