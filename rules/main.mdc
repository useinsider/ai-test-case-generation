# Generate test cases based on Jira description, analyzed Figma design, Confluence Document and Product Informations via MCP

When a chat message is sent and it contains "Create test scenearios for" and it contains a Jira Task ID like "PA-12345" or "MES-67890" run the following steps:

  1. Extract Jira Task ID (e.g., PA-12345) from the message and store it as `jiraId`.
  2. If the message contains a Figma URL, extract Figma File ID (e.g., FIG-12345) from the message and store it as `figmaId`.
  3. If the message contains a Confluence URL, extract and store it as `confluenceUrl`.
  4. If the message contains a Product Information, read the related product information and store that information as `productInformation`.
  5. Use `mcp` to fetch the Jira description for `jiraId` and store it in `jiraDescription`.
  6. If the message contains a Figma url, use `mcp` to fetch the analyzed Figma design for `figmaId` and store it in `figmaAnalysis`.
  7. If the message contains a Conflunce url, use `mcp` to fetch the content of the Confluence page and store it as `confluenceContent`.
  8. Read the contents of the [case-structure.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/case-structure.mdc) into a variable called `testRules`.
  9. Be sure that you have the all informations to generate test case. (jiraDescription, testRules, If figmaAnalysis is present, If confluenceContent is present, If productInformation is present)
  10. Append the following text to the end of the original message:

    """
    Jira Task Description:
    {{jiraDescription}}

    {{#if figmaAnalysis}}
    Figma Design Analysis:
    {{figmaAnalysis}}

    {{#if confluenceContent}}
    Confluence Documentation:
    {{confluenceContent}}

    {{#if productInformation}}
    Product Information:
    {{productInformation}}

    Test Rules:
    {{testRules}}
    """
